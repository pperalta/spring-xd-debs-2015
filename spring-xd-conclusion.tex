\section{Conclusion}

Mission critical data applications cannot live in a vacuum. The abundance of data
and specialized applications to process and store it require a holistic approach.
Spring XD is a formidable solution for managing the data flow and processing
between these applications. Spring XD integrates with systems ranging from decades
old RDBMS to cutting edge Big Data. The suite of Spring Framework projects that
Spring XD builds upon allows for flexible extensibility. The distributed runtime
built on ZooKeeper provides reliability and scale out capabilities for streams
and jobs.
