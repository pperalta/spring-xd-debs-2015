\section {Monitoring and Management}
 Spring XD makes it easier to manage and monitor the XD cluster and the
runtime components by providing useful metrics on those components and
user interface (shell and GUI) to interact with them.

\subsection {Monitoring via JMX and HTTP}
Spring XD supports configuring, monitoring and managing the runtime components
over HTTP and JMX. The admin, container, stream/job module components' runtime health,
environment, metrics can be accessed via the REST endpoints exposed by 
Spring Boot \cite{spring-boot}. One can also use JMX console to monitor and manage
the runtime components. The JMX metrics can also be obtained over HTTP using Jolokia.

\subsection {Management GUI}
Spring XD comes with an Admin GUI which lets the user manage the cluster environment,
stream and job monitoring and management which include monitoring the cluster health
with the deployed streams/jobs, workflows such as creation of batch jobs,
deployment of streams and jobs with runtime properties, monitoring the execution
of batch job, stop/restart the batch job when needed.

\subsection {Shell Interface}
Spring XD has the shell interface which is the main entry point for the user
to interact with XD admin to create/deploy and manage streams/jobs. This
interface implements all the REST endpoints exposed by Spring XD.
