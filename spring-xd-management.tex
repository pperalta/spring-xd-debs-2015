\section {Monitoring and Management}
Spring XD provides multiple options for management and monitoring of
its runtime components, including the following:\begin{itemize*}
	\item admin servers
	\item container servers
	\item stream and job modules
\end{itemize*}

\subsection {Monitoring via JMX and HTTP}
The runtime health, environment, and metrics information for these components
may be accessed via REST endpoints exposed by Spring Boot\cite{spring-boot}.
This functionality is also exposed via JMX; thus JMX clients such as JConsole
and Jolokia are supported.

\subsection {Management GUI}
Spring XD comes with an administrative web UI which allows users to manage
and monitor the system. The UI allows for the deployment and un-deployment
of streams and batch jobs. Batch Job module creation, control (start/stop)
and exploring job/step execution details are also supported.

\subsection {Shell Interface}
Spring XD includes an interactive shell which connects to the admin server
via the REST API. The shell exposes all of the management functionality
of the admin server.
