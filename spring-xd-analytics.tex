\section{Analytics}

Spring XD provides support to perform data analytics by adding analytical operations into 
an XD module. While the main stream collects the data from various sources into big data 
store such as HDFS , the main stream can be tapped at various stages and the tapped data 
can further be analyzed. This capability lets the analysts to perform data analytics in a
non-invasive manner. The analytics module can also be implemented to write the analytics 
data result into a data store (sink module) or sending the results to subsequent modules 
for processing (processor module).

Spring XD has out of the box analytics modules such as counter, field value counter, 
aggregate counter, gauge, rich gauge. Spring XD provides support for running predictive 
analytics using PMML model scoring. There is a support to run a module that executes s
hell command. This helps running R or python based processor or sink module implementation
 which could perform dynamic model scoring easier. One can also run Spark MLLib job as a 
 XD job and get out of the box capability to monitor and manage the job.

\subsection {Basic Analytics}

To perform some of the basic analytic operations, Spring XD provides following out of the 
box modules. Since these modules are implemented to write the analytic results back to a
data store they are considered as XD sink modules. Writing the analytic data into a data 
store is implemented using an extensible data store repository implementation 
(currently in-memory and Redis). The written analytic data are exposed via REST API. 
This way one can write a simple end-to-end application quickly to gain access to the 
analytic data results.

\subsubsection {Counter}

This module counts the number of events triggered on various stages of a stream. 
The main stream can be tapped at various stages and one can count the number of 
messages sent out at each stage. The counter value gets written to the data store.
 
\subsubsection {Field Value Counter} 

When there is a need to count the occurrence of a specific field from the message 
payload at various stages of a stream, field value counter can be used. Out of the box, 
XD supports the following message payload types:
POJO (Java Bean), Tuple, JSON string

\subsubsection {Aggregate Counter}

Aggregate counter is similar to the simple counter but also keeps track of time period. 
One can query the total count values for each minute, hour, day and month of the period in 
which data was collected/analyzed. 

\subsubsection {Gauge}
Gauge is a metric that represents a single long value associated with a unique name. 
In Spring XD, the gauge metric sink expects a numeric value as a payload.

\subsubsection {Rich Gauge}
Rich Gauge is a metric that holds a double value associated with a unique name. In 
addition to the value, this metric keeps a running average along with the minimum and 
maximum values and the count.

\subsection {Predictive Analytics using PMML}
  Spring XD provides support for running real time model scoring using PMML model evaluator. One can write an XD process module that does the real time evaluation of various machine learning scoring algorithms using JPMML evaluator. This evaluator supports wide range of model types and is interoperable with models exported from R, Rattle, KNIME, and RapidMiner. Once the analytical model is defined as a PMML model, the evaluator can run model scoring based on the input data being ingested.

\par

   Shell based processor/sink implementation could be useful to run some of the predictive analytics algorithms  and dynamically update the model which makes predictive analytics more adaptive.

\subsection{Spark MLLib}
   Using out of the box sparkApp job module, one can run any spark application as an XD job. A spark MLLib algorithm can be run as a sparkApp job in XD.
