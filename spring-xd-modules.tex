\section{Modules}
\label{sec:Modules}
A Spring XD Module is a unit of data processing. There are four
types: source, processor, sink, and job. Modules in Spring XD are defined in their
own application context. This allows for easy encapsulation and life cycle management
for modules. Additionally, the use of an application context allows for easy module
expansion.

Spring XD sink and source modules are Message Endpoints 
\cite{enterprise-integration-pattern-message-endpoint} 
that are responsible for sending data to and receiving data from external applications.
A source is the entry point for data into the stream. A sink is the module that dispatches
the stream's results to an external application or storage system. Batch jobs are used to
execute batch processing steps on a set of data.

\par

Spring XD offers a suite of 23 sources, 24 sinks and 9 jobs that are ready to use at startup.
These modules integrate with a variety of well known and popular data stores
and processing systems such as JDBC, HDFS, MongoDB, Spark, and Sqoop.
If an existing module does not meet the needs of a given use case, Spring XD supports custom
modules.

\par

\subsection{Modules: Source}
Source modules receive inbound data and convert it to messages for
use by modules in a stream or by a batch job.
There are two source types: poller and event driven.  A poller source is based on the polling
consumer pattern \cite{enterprise-integration-pattern-pollingconsumer}. It
will poll an external application (such as a web service, FTP server, database) for data at a
configurable interval. An event driven source is based on the event driven
consumer pattern \cite{enterprise-integration-pattern-eventdrivenconsumer} which will
open a port to listen for incoming data that is pushed from an external application.

\par

Spring XD uses Spring Integration \cite{spring-integration-reference} as its foundation
for implementing source and sink modules. Integration modules are
comprised minimally of one channel and an integration bean.  In the case of a source module
there is an ``output'' channel to dispatch messages transmitted by the integration bean to
the stream (see figure~\ref{fig:sourcembc}.)

\subsection{Modules: Sink}
Sink modules convert and deliver messages from a stream in a format consumable by an external application.
There are two types of sinks: counter/gauge and delegate.
A counter/gauge is a specialized sink that increments a field on a data store every time a
message is received. (Refer to the Analytics section for more information.)  A delegate
sink translates messages to the format expected by the external application.
After transforming the message, the resulting data is sent to the external application.

\par

The basic sink is comprised of a ``input'' channel and an integration bean.
The input channel receives all messages from the stream and dispatches
messages to the integration bean (see figure~\ref{fig:sinkmbc}.) It is the responsibility of
the integration bean to implement retry behavior in cases of failure. The sinks included
in Spring XD have configurable options for retries.

\subsection{Modules: Processor}

\subsection{Modules: Job}
Spring XD uses Spring Batch \cite{spring-batch-reference} as the foundation for implementing
job modules. A job enables users to execute enterprise batch processes within Spring XD.
Jobs are typically used when running long lasting tasks that have transactional requirements.
Thus in cases that the job fails, a job can be designed to be restarted and
pickup where it left off or rollback the changes that were in transaction.

\par

A job is typically comprised of a job definition along with the supporting
bean(s) as shown in figure~\ref{fig:batchmbc}.
In some cases the job definition alone is sufficient to implement the desired behavior.

\subsection{Modules: Deployment}
Modules are deployed in the modules directory and are segregated in
subdirectories by type: \texttt{modules/source}, \texttt{modules/sink} and \texttt{modules/job}.
These modules are dynamically loaded when a stream or job is deployed that requires that
specific module.
